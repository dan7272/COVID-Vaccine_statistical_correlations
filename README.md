# COVID-Vaccine_statistical_correlations
Abstract
The novel Coronavirus became a global pandemic in early 2020 and governments worldwide were tasked with understanding how to emerge from the pandemic. Understandably, there was a large focus on vaccines and this study will investigate the effectiveness of these vaccines with regards to reducing severity of COVID and the transmission of cases. The objective of this study is to better understand how, throughout 2021, the vaccines effected the severity of COVID and the transmission of cases. The data was collected by Our World in Data in partnership with Oxford University and covers countries from each continent around the world. The responsibility of the reporting of the data fell to the individual nations.
