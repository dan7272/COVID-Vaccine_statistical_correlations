### Abstract

*The novel Coronavirus became a global pandemic in early 2020 and
governments worldwide were tasked with understanding how to emerge from
the pandemic. Understandably, there was a large focus on vaccines and
this study will investigate the effectiveness of these vaccines with
regards to reducing severity of COVID and the transmission of cases. The
objective of this study is to better understand how, throughout 2021,
the vaccines effected the severity of COVID and the transmission of
cases. The data was collected by Our World in Data in partnership with
Oxford University and covers countries from each continent around the
world. The responsibility of the reporting of the data fell to the
individual nations.*

### Objectives

Analyse the following hypothesis:

-   H1 - An increase in the number of people vaccinated will reduce the
    number of deaths

-   H2 - An increase in the number of people vaccinated will reduce the
    severity of COVID

-   H3 - An increase in the number of people vaccinated will not effect
    the transmission of cases.

```

### Define Variables for the study

**Independent variables** (Standardized x hundred)

-   Vaccination

**Dependent variables** (Standardized x hundred)

-   Cases
-   Deaths
-   Hospitalization
-   ICU Hospitalization

**Latent/control variables** (Standardized x hundred)

-   Health indices (Hosp, beds, IDH)
-   Development indicators (GDP, POP, POP Density)

### Understanding the variables

```{r explain, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
d = d[,c(2,3,11,12,14,15,18,20,21,22,27,28,34,36,37,38,39,40)]    # Only the variables we want a study
n = names(d)
names(d)[1] = "CONT"
names(d)[2] = "COUN"
names(d)[3] = "CASES.T"
names(d)[4] = "CASES.N"
names(d)[5] = "DEATHS.T"
names(d)[6] = "DEATHS.N"
names(d)[7] = "ICU"
names(d)[8] = "HOSP"
names(d)[9] = "VAC.T"
names(d)[10] = "PEOPLE.V"
names(d)[11] = "VAC.p"
names(d)[12] = "PEOPLE.V.p"
names(d)[13] = "POP"
names(d)[14] = "GDP.PC"
names(d)[15] = "HEART.R"
names(d)[16] = "BEDS"
names(d)[17] = "HDI"
names(d)[18] = "DATE"
# d$DATE = as.Date(d$DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
cbind(names(d),n)
```

Firstly, the vaccinations appear to have little effect on the number of
cases. With every increase in vaccination per 100 people, there is an
increase of 0.55 cases. This suggests that the presence of a vaccine has
encouraged societies to take less care and fast-tracked governments
relaxation of the rules.

Secondly, the reduction of ICU patients when vaccinations per hundred
people increases is clear. With every increase in vaccination per 100
people there is a 0.24 decrease in the number of ICU patients per
million. This shows the vaccine is reducing the severity of COVID much
more than the transmission of cases.

Furthermore, the number of new deaths per million decreases with an
increase in the number of vaccinations per 100 people by 0.08.
Strengthening the idea that severity of COVID and, as a bi-product,
deaths will be reduce as vaccine take up increased.

From this we can settle on the following hypothesis:

H1 - An increase in the number of people vaccinated will reduce the
number of deaths

H2 - An increase in the number of people vaccinated will reduce the
severity of COVID

H3 - An increase in the number of people vaccinated will not effect the
transmission of cases.

### Plots

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
dES = filter(d, COUN == 'Spain')
ay <- list(
  tickfont = list(color = "red"),
  overlaying = "y",
  side = "right",
  range = c(0,8000),
  title = "Cases")
fig = plot_ly(data = dES, x = ~DATE, y = ~DEATHS.N, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = "Deaths") %>%

              yaxis = list(range = c(0,30), title = "Deaths"),
              yaxis2 = ay,
              xaxis = list(rangeslider = list(visible = T),
                        tick0 = "2000-01-15" ,dtick= "M4",
                        rangeselector=list(
                          buttons=list(
                            list(count=1, label="1m", step="month", stepmode="backward"),
                            list(count=6, label="6m", step="month", stepmode="backward"),
                          list(count=1, label="YTD", step="year", stepmode="todate"),

                        ))))

```

The above graph explains how the number of deaths acted across the
period between May 2020 and January 2022 in Spain. It should be made
clear that this is the number of New Deaths, not accumulative deaths,
which explains the volatile nature of the data.

d$ICU = log(d$ICU+0.0001)

### Regressions

-   Fixed Variables

```{r reg2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
reg2 = lm(d$DEATHS.N ~ d$CASES.N + d$PEOPLE.V.p)
summary(reg2)

```

Based on the above regression, where deaths are standardized per
million, we have evidence to support hypothesis one. It would be
expected that an increase in the number of cases would explain an
increase in the number of deaths. However, as the number of vaccinations
per hundred increases, it would be expected that the number of deaths
should decrease. Here, we can interpret that for every increase in
vaccinations per hundred a country gives, there will be a decrease of
0.024 new deaths per million, supporting the notion that an increase in
the number of vaccinations there are will represent a decrease in the
number of deaths.

We can also understand further that the effect of new deaths is
relatively comparable across all CONTs, which leads us to believe there
is less merit in exploring this relationship.

-   **Spain**

```{r ES, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
ES = filter(d, COUN == 'Spain')  # Filter only Spain
EU = filter(d, CONT == 'Europe')  # Filter only Europe
lm_ES = lm(ES$DEATHS.N ~ ES$CASES.N +
                          ES$HOSP +
                          ES$ICU +
                          ES$PEOPLE.V.p) 

summary(lm_ES)   # Very good one!!!!.. but 277 df haha :,)

```

<!--# Change this comments: (because the lm() changed -->

The regression above makes interesting reading. The number of people
vaccinated per hundred in Spain is an extension of the previous analysis
we witnessed in the Pairs Panel above, as vaccinations increase the
number of deaths decrease. Interestingly, the total number of
vaccinations per hundred people has increased the number of ICU patients
per million. It is likely that this is a reflection on the booster doses
that have been issued because they are unlikely to reduce the number of
ICU patients per million, but instead maintain the level that the
initial rounds of vaccine achieved.

```{r ES1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(ES$ICU ~ ES$PEOPLE.V.p + ES$HOSP)
```

```{r ES_model, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
model = "DEATHS.N ~ 1*ICU+
          1*PEOPLE.V.p;

          1*PEOPLE.V.p;
        CASES.N ~ PEOPLE.V.p"

model2 = "DEATHS.N ~ 1*ICU+

          1*CASES.N +

         curvature = 1, style="lisrel",weighted=TRUE)
round(fitMeasures(fit)[c(3:5, 23)],4) # not sure whether it's a good model... 
semPaths(fit2,what="std",sizeMan=12,edge.label.cex=1.5,nCharNodes = 8,
         curvature = 3, style="lisrel",weighted=TRUE)
round(fitMeasures(fit2)[c(3:5, 23)],4) 
```

As previously explained, there is a negative correlation between people
vaccinated per hundred and the total number of ICU patients. This is
best depicted in the graphs above. At the point of 0 vaccinations per
hundred, there is close to 100 ICU patients per million. It should be
noted that there were reports of Spanish hospitals being at capacity
throughout the pandemic which suggests, without capacity constraints,
these numbers may have been higher. As the number of people vaccinated
increased, the number of ICU patients decreased.

The graphs remain relatively volatile throughout the range of number of
people vaccinated per hundred which can be interpreted to represent the
evolving nature of the virus. The number of people vaccinated could be
used as a proxy for time, as this number is only capable of increasing.
Therefore the peaks on the graphs above are likely to represent the
waves of the pandemic.

## Model proposed by Albert

For this model 4 latent variables were defined, Cases, Vaccination,
Hospitalization and Deaths, all of them with measure indicators of the
daily average per million on each quarter of: cases, vaccines,
hospitalizations and deaths.

The bivariate analysis shows correlations among the variables, initially
there is not multidisciplinary detected meaning there is variation
between variables and the periods.

```{r 2data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
dd<-read_excel("C:/Users/danie/OneDrive - UPF-BSM/2. Second Term/Marketing Research/Final Case/Covidfinal.xlsx")

model56 = "#Latents
              Ca =~ 1*log(Cases.NQ1) + 1*log(Cases.NQ2) + 1*log(Cases.NQ3)+ 1*log(Cases.NQ4);
              Hos =~ 1*log(HospQ1) + 1*log(HospQ2) + 1*log(HospQ3) + 1*log(HospQ4);
              Dea =~ 1*log(Deaths.NQ1) + 1*log(Deaths.NQ2) + 1*log(Deaths.NQ3) + 1*log(Deaths.NQ4);
              Vac =~ 1*log(People.VQ1) + 1*log(People.VQ2) + 1*log(People.VQ3) + 1*log(People.VQ4); 
            # Regressions
              Dea ~ Ca + Hos + Vac;
              Hos ~ Vac
"
          
fit_56 <- sem(model56,data = dd)
semPaths(fit_56,what="std",sizeMan=6,edge.label.cex=0.8,nCharNodes = 4,curvature = 2, style="lisrel",weighted=TRUE)
round(fitMeasures(fit_56)[c(3:5, 23)],4)
summary(fit_56)
```

In this model we see strong correlations between the latent variables
Cases, Vaccinations, deaths and Hospitalization and their respective
indicators of each quarter. Furthermore, we see that Vaccination has
high negative beta regression coefficient (-3.30) against Deaths. This
means that as expected the more vaccinations are executed the less
deaths are expected. Also vaccinations have high negative beta
regression coefficient (-1) with hospitalizations. Meaning vaccines are
helping to decrease severe cases. Another feature is that Cases present
a positive beta regression coefficient with deaths, meaning the more
cases, more deaths are expected.

Finally this model explains, with a high negative beta regression
coefficient, that hospitalization decreases deaths. Principal assumption
is that the higher the hospitalizations the less deaths will be
produced, therefore countries should make high investments in hospitals
to diminish covid severity.

The disturbance Terms for Cases are 0.89, 0.44, 0.82 and 0.93 for
Q1,Q2,Q3 & Q4, meaning there 11%,56%, 18% and 7% of the variances of
each quarter is caused by variables not controlled. Disturbance are low
probably because covid increases similarly among similar countries,
therefore there are not many external variables that explain variations
in new cases.

The disturbance Terms for Vaccination are 0.8, 0.94, 0.96 and 0.95 for
Q1,Q2,Q3 & Q4, meaning there 20%,16%, 4% and 5% of the variances of each
quarter is caused by variables not controlled. The low disturbance terms
is satisfactory for the model, for instance the amount of vaccination
per millions applied for covid should not be caused by many external
variables rather than the country. which in this case vaccines were
distributed in the world considering the population of each country.

However, Disturbance terms for Hospitalization seems to be higher, this
is because not only hospitals capacity is very different from country to
country but health investment and life style.

This model presents some issues, the P value very low and the degrees of
freedom are high, meaning it is not reliable. Further investigation
needs to be done in order to find a more suitable model. Which is why
modification indices were driven to find a better fit.

It also important noticing that there are a lot of missing considering
that some countries are not very accurate on their reporting abilities.

In contrast to previous models, the above model is not effected by the
high numbers of missing data. Previously, the reporting of
hospitalizations led us to have very high numbers of missings.

The aggregation of missing data, as shown above, reflects the high level
of missingness in quarter 1 of 2021. This is centered around the rate of
vaccine roll out around the world and therefore has been left out of
this model.

The model shows us the effect of vaccination on cases. As previously
mentioned, we did not expect the vaccine roll out to reduce the number
of cases and thus the transmission of the virus. This is evident here as
the estimate of the regression is 0.993. In context, this is likely to
be explained by the Omicron variant. Furthermore, as vaccines were
rolled out worldwide, governments were more lenient with restrictions,
aware that this would increase the number of cases but confident that as
the vaccines took hold the severity of COVID would reduce.

With more reliable data, we could implement the aforementioned model in
which latent variables were assigned to assess the severity of COVID and
prove this hypothesis. Regrettably, without this data, this explanation
will have to suffice.

Whilst we still have some modification indices that are high, this is
the limit of where we can introduce correlations between variables and
still receive an output including standard errors. In the model, some of
the correlations have been frozen, meaning they will not be included in
the model but show where the desired correlations would be introduced if
possible.

```

Based on the above model, we can see the effect that the GDP of the
country and the number of hospital beds per thousand has on the number
of cases a country has. Focusing on the Path Diagram, we can see that
there is a positive effect of both of these variables on the number of
cases. Number of Hospital Beds and GDP act as proxy's for the level of
development of the country, suggesting that countries that are more
developed had more cases of COVID throughout the period analyzed.
Initially this may seem counter-intuitive, however it is more likely to
be a reflection of how effectively the countries reported the data.

This model also suffers from missingness, although not to the same
extent as the initial model, which suggests that there are reliability
issues around how well the GDP and Hospital Beds were reported. As we
can see from the aggregation of missingness analysis, the levels of
missingness in Hospital Beds and GDP is relatively high.

The modification indices of this model are very low, including the EPC
column, which shows how much the model could change if the correlations
were included. From the modification indices, we can conclude that the
the effect of the rhs on the lhs is insignificant and would not have a
great effect on the model if it were to be included.

## Summary

In summary, we have identified 3 Hypothesis relating to the
effectiveness of the vaccines and proven Hypothesis 3, that increases in
vaccinations in the population will not negatively effect the number of
cases. Furthermore, we identified a model that looked to incorporate
severity of COVID and number of deaths in to the equation to understand
the vaccines effect of this. However, this study was hampered by
missingness within the data.

An opportunity for further research would be to collect a more complete
data set to further analyze the effectiveness of the vaccines on
severity of COVID and deaths.
